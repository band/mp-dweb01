# Test Setup

Primary aim: document steps to test the "MarkPub Quickstart"
instructions.  


1. Make a directory and populate with some Markdown documents.


2. OPTIONAL: Make it an Obsidian vault  
DONE: create some wiki-links ...  
TODO: install ObsidianGit plugin  
 - note: ObsidianSync plugin enabled by default?  - DISABLE

3. Make it a GitHub repository  
TODO: put the CLI steps here  
 - note: a GitHub repository MUST be created before adding content.
 - TODO: what is the simplest way to get started?
	 - one way: from GitHub.com create an empty repository

4. MarkPub initialization  

5. Netlify setup?  

6. Test deployment  

TODO: separate this into two documents  
- one for pre-MarkPub install and init  
- one to test the MarkPub install and use instructions

from Dr. Beth Sawin, co-founder of Climate Interactive, shares her vision for [how we might ‘multisolve’ our way to a more livable planet.](https://atmos.earth/interconnected-problems-call-for-interconnected-solutions-elizabeth-sawin-climate-interactive/)

> In systems theory, we talk about ‘emergence’ as something that happens when you change the connections in a system. ... You don’t know exactly what will happen when you connect the affordable housing group, the land group, the water group and the jobs group in a city, but something different will happen than if they had been disconnected.

> I don't think climate "safe havens," if they exist, are places. I think they are a direction not a guarantee and I think they look like movements towards changed thinking, towards design for a destabilizing climate, towards commitment to wellbeing of one another, and most of all towards changes in power and its uses to enable the changed thinking, design, investment, etc.
